abstract: 'In this article, we introduce an updated version of the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and
Outcomes dataset (NAVCO 2.1), which compiles annual data on 389 nonviolent and violent
mass movements for regime change, anti-occupation, and secession from 1945 to 2013. This
version of the dataset corrects known coding errors in NAVCO 2.0, adds news cases (including
the Arab uprisings), and codes attributes for each campaign year (such as participation size and
diversity, the behavior of regime elites, repression and its effects, support from external actors,
and campaign outcomes). In addition, NAVCO 2.1 adds several new attributes to each
campaign-year, including more precise participation figures, more nuanced data about the
scope, intensity, and degree of violent flank behavior and state repression, and further
information about the parallel or alternative institutions developed by the campaign. The data
reveal four key findings: (1) that the success rate of nonviolent resistance campaigns has
declined since 2001; (2) that far more people have participated in nonviolent than violent
campaigns in the postwar period; (3) that nonviolent campaigns suffer far fewer per-capita
fatalities than armed campaigns; and (4) that incidental violence by dissidents has become a
more common feature of contemporary nonviolent campaigns compared with earlier cases. The
article concludes with suggestions for further research.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  'In this article, we introduce the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) 
2.1 dataset, which adds several new variables to NAVCO 2.0 as well as significantly expanding its
temporal scope. We use these data to describe seven decades of global resistance and to probe
several claims garnered from existing literature.'

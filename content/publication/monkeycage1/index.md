abstract: 'In this post for the Washington Post's Monkey Cage, we take stock of recent nonviolent 
massmovements, and draw several inferences about the ways activists and governments have evolved 
to contend against one another. First, nonviolent movements are increasingly dealing with /'violent
flanks./' Second, technological innovation both helps and hinders organizers. Third, dictators are
relying on counterdemonstrations. And finally, leaderless movements face greater barriers to
capitalize on tactical victories against governments.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  'In this article, we introduce the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) 
2.1 dataset, which adds several new variables to NAVCO 2.0 as well as significantly expanding its
temporal scope. We use these data to describe seven decades of global resistance and to probe
several claims garnered from existing literature.'

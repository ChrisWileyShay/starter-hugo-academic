abstract: 'In this post, I discuss my recent article published in the *Journal of Peace Research*, in which I argue 
that violent resistance strategies normalize and institutionalize severe state repression. Because nonviolent tactics 
do not have this effect, unarmed resistance leads to much less subsequent repression compared to armed resistance. 
Quantitative evidence suggests that this is true even when nonviolent movements fail to achieve primary goals like regime 
change (the majority of cases). Results also suggest that the repressive legacies of armed resistance persist even after 
democratization.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  'In this blog post, I discuss my article *Swords Into Ploughshares?* which explores how nonviolent resistance leads
to less future state repression compared to violent resistance.'

abstract: 'In this post, we take stock of recent nonviolent mass movements, drawing four inferences about the
ways activists and governments have evolved to contend against one another. First, nonviolent movements are 
increasingly dealing with violent fringe elements. Second, technological innovations have both helped
and hindered movement organizers. Third, dictators are increasingly relying on counterdemonstrations. And
finally, it is harder for leaderless movements to capitalize on tactical victories against governments.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  'Social media has made mass protests easier to organize â€” but, perhaps paradoxically, harder to resolve.'

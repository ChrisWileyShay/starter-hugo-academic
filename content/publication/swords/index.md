abstract: 'Human rights abuse tends to increase during national crises, such as civil wars and mass
nonviolent uprisings. Under what conditions does this abuse abate or persist? I argue that violent 
challenges provoke much more coercive state responses — exposing more personnel within the security 
forces to extreme forms of repression and priming them (both leaders and followers) to reproduce 
these behaviors after the conflict has terminated. This effect is mitigated or avoided when challengers 
rely on nonviolent tactics instead of violence, leading to less post-conflict abuse. I test this 
argument with several quantitative methods, which establish a positive association between nonviolent 
resistance campaigns and subsequent freedom from political killings. Results also suggest that 
democratization can partially — but not fully — counteract the repressive legacies of violent conflict.
By choosing to specialize in nonviolent tactics, therefore, resistance leaders avoid a repression trap 
that not even democratization can fully disarm.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  'In this article, I explore how violent and nonviolent campaigns shape future state repression. 
I find that nonviolent campaigns lead to significantly fewer extrajudicial killings after campaign 
termination compared to violent campaigns.'
